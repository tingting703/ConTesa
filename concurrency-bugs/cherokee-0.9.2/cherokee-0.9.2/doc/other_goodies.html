    <meta name="Description" content="Cherokee is a flexible, very fast, lightweight Web server. It is implemented entirely in C, and has no dependencies beyond a standard C library. It is embeddable and extensible with plug-ins. It supports on-the-fly configuration by reading files or strings, TLS/SSL (via GNUTLS or OpenSSL), virtual hosts, authentication, cache friendly features, PHP, custom error management, and much more." />

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>There are several important features of Cherokee that really do make a
difference in real-world production environments.</p></div>
<h3 id="cherokee-admin">Cherokee-Admin</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="para"><p>Cherokee bundles a one of a kind UI to set up every available feature
without the need of editing any configuration files by hand. It is a
modern and easy to manage application that allows to set up the server
with speed and ease. The interface is thoroughly documented trhoughout
Cherokee's documentation.</p></div>
<h3 id="cherokee-tweak">Cherokee-Tweak</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="para"><p>The swiss-army knife of the Cherokee bundle. This little tool enables
you, among other things, to rotate the logs with absolutely no
downtime at all. No connections are lost. No delay happens. It can
also be used to trace Cherokee's state on the fly, even remotely and
on production servers.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>This tool has its own documentation under the
<a href="bundle_cherokee-tweak.html">cherokee-tweak</a> section.</p></div>
<h3 id="x-sendifle">X-Sendfile</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="para"><p>X-Sendfile is a special, non-standard HTTP header that has been
supported by Cherokee for a while. At first you might think it is no
big deal, but think again.It can be enabled in any CGI, FastCGI or
SCGI backend. Basicaly its job is to instruct the web server to ignore
the content of the response and replace it by whatever is specified in
the header. The main advantage of this is that it will be Cherokee the
one serving the file, making use of all its optimizations. It is
useful for processing script-output of e.g. php, perl, ruby or any
cgi.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>This is particularly useful because it hands the load to Cherokee, all
the response headers from the backend are forwarded, the whole
application uses a lot less resources and performs several times
faster not having to worry about a task best suited for a web server.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>You retain the ability to check for special privileges or dynamically
deciding anything contemplated by your backend's logic, you speed up
things a lot while having more resources freed, and you can even
specify the delivery of files outside of the web server's document
root path. Of course, this is to be done solely in controled
environments. In short, it offers a huge performance gain at
absolutely no cost.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Note that the X-Sendfile feature also supports <tt>X-Accel-Redirect</tt>
header, a similar feature offered by other web servers.
This is to allow the migration of applications supporting it whithout
having to make major code rewrites.</p></div>
<h3 id="zero-downtime">Zero Downtime Updates</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="para"><p>Cherokee has an ability hardly ever seen in any service delivering
application, be it web content, multimedia streaming or almost any
other server you can think of.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Whenever a configuration change is applied, it is immediately
reflected in the web server with no downtime requirements to restart
the server. Of course the connections that are already being served
will continue normally with the same parameters that where negotiated
with the requesting clients, but they will not be shut down just to
perform a menial task such as restarting the server.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>In fact, this mechanism is not only limited to configuration
updates. Cherokee is so smart that it can even apply this to perform
full program upgrades. This means you can completely replace the
binaries for new ones, launch the enhanced versions and yet not suffer
any downtime. Zero connection losses, no lag associated. Guaranteed.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>This might seem as just another cool feature, but is in fact
huge. Just think about it: an extremely high traffic site cannot
afford to be down. Ever. Not to upgrade the webserver. Not to enhance
it. Not to reflect a new configuration setting. Thousands of hits per
second depend on it.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>With Cherokee you can cope with this and much more. With Cherokee, it's
easier done than said.</p></div>
<h3 id="ssl-vhosts">SSL Virtual Hosts</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="para"><p>You might have been told elsewhere that named virtual hosts in SSL
cannot be supported without SNI (Server Name Indication) because a web
server cannot see the hostname header when the SSL request is being
processed. Technically this might have been correct in the past. The
first thing that the server has to do is to connect with the other end
by using SSL/TLS. The user entered host part of the URI must match the
Common Name (CN) provided by the certificate. Since virtual hosts are in
use, the CN of the first available certificate may or may not match
the one specified in the early stages of TLS negotiation.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>However, nothing is forever.. and that applies to SSL/TLS connections
as well. Cherokee elegantly respins the SSL layer once it knows the
virtual server, and the magic occurs: SSL supporting several
certificates on the same IP address and port.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Besides this there is a cleaner, more standard aproach called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication">Server Name
Indication</a> (SNI) that sends the name of the virtual host during the
TLS negotiation.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>If <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4366#section-3.1">SNI</a> is
supported by your SSL/TLS library, the SSL layer does not need to be
restarted. Since the host info can be put in the SSL handshake, things
will simply work as long as there is a web browser with SNI support at
the other side. Currently every modern web browser supports this, and
Cherokee has TLS SNI support for both the GNUTLS and OpenSSL backends.</p></div>
<h3 id="dbslayer">Database load balancing</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="para"><p>Ever heard of the <strong>DB Access Layer</strong>, AKA
<a href="http://code.nytimes.com/projects/dbslayer/">DBSlayer</a>?</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>In case you haven't, DBSlayer is a database abstraction and pooling
layer designed to be simple to use (it's a DB abstraction layer for
the web age built on top of HTTP and JSON).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Well, Cherokee ships our very own
<a href="modules_handlers_dbslayer.html">DBSlayer</a> handler that provides
the fastest implementation in existence. It also provides several
interesting enhancements.</p></div>
