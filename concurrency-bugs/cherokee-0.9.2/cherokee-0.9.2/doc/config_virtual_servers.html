<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p><em>Virtual Server</em> is an abstraction mechanism that allows you to define
a custom number of parameters and rules that have to be applied to one
or more domains.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>In a Cherokee server there must be at least one virtual server named
default, and there is no maximum number. It is important to know that
this server cannot be deleted.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>When the server receives a request it will try to match the domain
name specified in the virtual server that should handle it. In case no
virtual server matches the request, default will be used.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Three main options are accessible through this menu:</p></div>
<div class="olist"><ol>
<li>
<p>
Virtual Server List
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Add new Virtual Server
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Clone Virtual Server
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="para"><p><strong>Cloning a Virtual Server</strong> is simply a matter of selecting a target name
and a source virtual server currently present. Every setting will be
duplicated. From then onwards changes applied to any of them, be it
the original or the copied Virtual Servers, will only apply to the
implicated one. This is a great way to set up complex domains,
since you can use the existing ones as templates to be refined with
further work.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><strong>To add a new Virtual Server</strong> you have to enter the server name and a
valid Document Root directory.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="media/images/admin_vserver.png" alt="Virtual server" title="Virtual server"/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="ilist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Document Root</strong>
</p>
<div class="para"><p>This directive sets the directory from which Cherokee will serve
files. The set of rules is checked from the highest to the lowest
possible priority. Once a rule is matched, the server appends the path
from the requested URL to the document root to make the path to the
document. If it is a directory, this information is used. If other
rules apply to a parent directory, those are applied as well without
overwriting the original behavior:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>        http://www.example.com/index.html refers to /var/www/index.html</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>This might seem complicated but it's actually simple to
understand. For example suppose you had a directory called /secret
that was protected with authentication, and there was also a rule with
higher priority for /secret/cgi that only specified to use the CGI
handler. Under these circumstances, if a request was received for
/secret/cgi/something then the CGI handler would be taken and it would
inherit the authentication specified for /secret.</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Name</strong>
</p>
<div class="para"><p>Name is an alias. The domain names handled by the virtual server
should be specified later in the virtual server details page.</p></div>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="para"><p>The <strong>Virtual Server List</strong> is by far the most interesting of these
three main options. It gives an overview of the existing virtual
servers, and allows to configure in detail every possible setting.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="media/images/admin_vserver_vserver.png" alt="Virtual server overview" title="Virtual server overview"/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="para"><p>A detailed explanation of every tab follows.</p></div>
<h3 id="_basics">Basics</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="ilist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Directory Indexes</strong>
</p>
<div class="para"><p>The DirectoryIndex directive sets the list of resources to look for
when the client requests an index of the directory by specifying a /
at the end of the directory name. Several URLs may be given, in which
case the server will return the first one that it finds. If none of
the resources exist, the server will reply according to the handler
behavior.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Note that the documents do not need to be relative to the directory:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>        index.html,index.txt,/cgi-bin/index.pl</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>would cause the CGI script /cgi-bin/index.pl to be executed if neither
index.html nor index.txt existed in a directory.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>There is a special case in which the directory index entry starts with
a slash. For example, /cgi-bin/index.pl. In that case, it will use it
as the object accessible under that public address of the same virtual
server, so it will take care about the possible configuration of the
/cgi-bin/ directory and/or the pl extension.</p></div>
</li>
</ul></div>
<h3 id="_domain_names">Domain names</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="para"><p>This section allows to define the list of domains that the virtual
server implements.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>It can accept either FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Names) or wild
card entries.</p></div>
<div class="vlist"><dl>
<dt>
For instance
</dt>
<dd>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>          example.com
        *.example.org</tt></pre>
</div></div>
</dd>
</dl></div>
<div class="para"><p>Note that you should probably keep in mind the way this list is
interpreted in order to avoid future problems. Whenever Cherokee
recieves a request for a specific domain, it evaluates the <tt>Domain
list</tt> of every defined virtual host in the order defined by the
priorities of such hosts. When it finds a match, it stops the
evaluation and starts matching the specific rules from that virtual
host to send the apropriate response.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>If no domain name matches the request, Cherokee re-evaluates the list
of virtual hosts trying to match the request against the <tt>Nicknames</tt>,
also using the priorities defined by the virtual host order.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Only after failing both with the domain names and the nicknames will
Cherokee issue the failure.</p></div>
<h3 id="_behavior">Behavior</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="para"><p>This sections allows to define a set of rules to define how the server
should handle the different requests. A summary of the existing rules is
presented, containig several fields of information:</p></div>
<div class="olist"><ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Target</strong>: web target of the rule, be it a path, a file type, etc.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Type</strong>: Rule type. The will be explained in the following
    paragraphs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Handler</strong>: The handler that manages the requests that match this
    rule. Read on for further details.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Auth</strong>: Indicates if authentication is used for this rule. This
    can be set up through the <a href="config_virtual_servers_rule.html">Rule
    Entry</a> menu.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Final</strong>: If this flag is present it means that no other rules will
    be applied after this one, even if the request also matches other
    rules with lower priority.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="para"><p>These rules can be defined based on the directory that the request
targets, the extension of the file that it is requesting, or a regular
expression that may match the request. This is the list of available
rule types:</p></div>
<div class="ilist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Directory</strong>: The entry Directory encloses a group of directives which will
    apply only to the named directory and sub-directories of that directory.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Extensions</strong>: The entry Extensions doesn't care about directories, it will
    just look for the extension of the object requested.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Regular Expressions</strong>: The Request entry provides a powerful way to apply
    custom options to requests. It is a complement for the Directory and Extension
    entries. Basically, there are two differences between them:
</p>
<div class="ilist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
It uses regular expressions to define the requests in which the configuration
      will be applied.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
These entries are able to use the connection parameters (both pathinfo
      and query string). In this way it is possible to set rules based on
      parameter values.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Header</strong>: This type of rule is used to modify the behavior in
      response to the contents of HTTP headers. A regular expression
      is needed to match against. This kind of rule can be used to
      provide alternative contents to a specific type of users. For
      example, it can check if the HTTP referrer header refferences
      specific domains to allow or deny the delivery of the requested
      information.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>GeoIP</strong>: If GeoIP support is present, this type of rules can be
      added. The GeoIP library has to be present at build time for
      this to happen. If enabled, specific behavior can be offered
      depending on the country of origin of the requests to the web
      server. Note that the country is determined by matching the IPs
      to the actual list of countries handled by the library, so the
      usage of proxies on the user side will render this resolution
      mechanism inaccurate. An initial country must be added to the
      rule, and more selections can be added in further steps.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="para"><p>It is very important to know that these rules are prioritized. The
higher its priority is, the sooner they are checked. You could
think of a network routing table, it is quite similar. You can set the
relative priorities among the rules by simply dragging and dropping
them in the desired position (if you click on the rule name, you will be
redirected to the rule's configuration options; if you click anywhere
else, you will be able to drag and drop it into the desired position).</p></div>

<div class="content">
<img src="media/images/admin_behaviour.png" alt="Virtual server" title="Virtual server"/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="para"><p>Each of these behavior rules must specify which is the handler that
the server should use to reply to the requests that match the rule.
Handlers are the modules that generate the information with which the
server responds a client's request. By default Cherokee provides a
number of them:</p></div>

<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">It is quite easy to fully specify a virtual server's behavior having
just some notions of Cherokee's way of working. However, there might
be some corner cases where Cherokee will behave in a manner that could
not seem obvious at first. Every doubt can be easily cleared by simple
understanding in full detail the way a rule is applied. For instance
lets suppose there is an <tt>Extension</tt> type rule configured to handle
PHP files. If a request is made for
<tt>http://example.com/index.php/what/ever</tt>, this rule <strong>WOULD NOT</strong> be
applied at first because the request doesn't end with the appropriate
extension: it has some adittional path information. However, if there
is a <tt>Default</tt> rule configured that is managed by the <tt>List and Send</tt>
handler, things would work. This is because the <tt>Default</tt> rule would
catch any unmatched requests, and the <tt>List and Send</tt> handler would
notice the PATHINFO part of the request. It would then split the
request in two parts, separating the PHP file from the appended
information, and would then evaluate once more the list of rules. This
time the request would end in <tt>.php</tt> and thus it would match the
<tt>Extension</tt> rule meant to handle PHP files.</td>
