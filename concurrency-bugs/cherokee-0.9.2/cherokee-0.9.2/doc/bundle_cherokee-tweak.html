<p>
       cherokee-tweak  - Command-line interface to the Cherokee administrative
       interface

<strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
       cherokee-tweak connects to running cherokee instance, either  local  or
       remote, and requests it to perform one of several actions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>OPTIONS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
       cherokee-tweak accepts the following options:
</p>
<div class="vlist"><dl>
<dt>
-h, &#8212;help
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
               Shows brief usage information
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-V, &#8212;version
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
               Prints version and exits
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-u, &#8212;user= STRING
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
               Specifies the user name with which to identify to the server
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-p, &#8212;password=STRING
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
               Specifies the password with which to identify to the server
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-c, &#8212;command=STRING
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
               Required option. Command to execute: logrotate, trace or info
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-a, &#8212;url=URL
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
               Required  option. URL where the administrative interface can be
               found.  This target must be  defined  previously  in  cherokee-
               admin, enabling a "Remote Administration" type handler (Virtual
               Servers&#8594;Behaviour&#8594;Add new  rule,  and  then  Handler&#8594;"Remote
               Administration").  The  deffinition of a security mechanisim is
               highly encouraged.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-l, &#8212;log=PATH
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
               Log file to be rotated (Only to be used when -c is logrotate)
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-t, &#8212;trace=STRING
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
               Modules to be traced (Only to be used when -c is trace). Chero‚Äê
               kee must have been compiled with the &#8212;enable-trace for this to
               work. Everything traceable  with  CHEROKEE_TRACE  can  also  be
               traced this way.
</p>
</dd>

</dd>
</dl></div>
</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>To use <tt>cherokee-tweak</tt>, an administrative interface must be defined
within <a href="bundle_cherokee-admin.html">cherokee-admin</a>. That is, you
must define a path managed by the handler <tt>Remote
Administration</tt>. This can be done through the <em>Virtual Servers</em> option,
in <em>Behaviour</em> and using the <em>Add new rule</em> option.</p></div>

<div class="para"><p>Please note that while you are at it, the deffinition of a security
(through the <em>Security</em> tab) is highly encouraged. Although you have
the choice to, you should never use <em>None</em> as security mechanisim
since this would leave your system exposed to third parties using
<tt>cherokee-tweak</tt>.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Also note that the usage of the <tt>trace</tt> command has no effect unless
Cherokee is compiled with the <tt>&#8212;enable-trace</tt>. This is a debugging
option and it is unlikely to be present in binary version of Cherokee
not specifically compiled with this in mind.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Every module traceable with CHEROKEE_TRACE can also be traced this
way. Refer to the <a href="dev_debug.html">"Debugging"</a> section of the
documentation for more information on this matter.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Keep in mind one important thing: when the <tt>-t</tt> option is specificed,
<tt>cherokee-tweak</tt> activates the tracing functionality within the
<tt>cherokee</tt> instance. It does not provide tracing of its own. This
means the debugging information will appear in the machine that is
actually running the <tt>cherokee</tt> instance. This may or may not be the
same that is running the <tt>cherokee-tweak</tt> process.</p></div>
