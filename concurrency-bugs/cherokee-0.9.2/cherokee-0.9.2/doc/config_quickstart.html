<div class="para"><p>This section briefly describes the whole administration web interface
provided by <a href="bundle_cherokee-admin.html">cherokee-admin</a>. This is
the only recommended way of configuring Cherokee. If you are looking
for development information, you should refer to the appropriate
section, especially <a href="dev_cherokee.conf.html">cherokee.conf</a> file
specification.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>We will first show a quick overview of the available options, followed
by a simple walkthrough. You can learn more about the options in their
specific documentation entries.</p></div>
<h3 id="_overview">Overview</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="ilist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="config_status.html">Status</a>:
  This gives a quick view of the server status.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="config_general.html">General</a>:
  There are a number of entries that specify the most significant
  configuration options such as the port - or ports - that the server
  will listen to, the default timeout, whether to support keep-alive
  connections and so on.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="config_virtual_servers.html">Virtual servers</a>:
  If you want your web server to work with more than one domain you
  will have to create <a href="config_virtual_servers.html">Virtual
  servers</a> other than the <tt>default</tt> one. Each one will have a
  completely independent configuration: paths, behavior, logging
  facilities, etc.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="config_info_sources.html">Info Sources</a>:
  Define the resources that will be providing information. For
  instance, PHP.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="config_icons.html">Icons</a>:
  Associate icon images with one or more file extensions. Used to
  offer directory listings.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="config_mime_types.html">Mime Types</a>:
  Manage MIME types.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="config_advanced.html">Advanced</a>:
  This is to configure the most complex parameters of the server and how
  it interacts with the operating system. If you are unsure about any of
  the options here, better not mingle with them. Default values should
  work just fine.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<h3 id="_walkthrough">Walkthrough</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="para"><p>There is very little set up you must do to have a perfectly functional
web server out of the box. Cherokee's default configuration can be
used to serve any typical PHP-driven dynamic website.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>If you have a specific need, you should check out the recipes present in
the <em>Cookbook</em> section of the documentation. Among other subjects, you
can find information about
<a href="cookbook_optimizations.html">Cherokee optimizations</a>,
setting up efficient <a href="cookbook_authentication.html">Authentication</a>
mechanisms, or configuring several popular application frameworks.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>In this tutorial we will be setting up a system with a couple of
virtual servers, PHP support, some redirection rules and a simple
authentication mechanism.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>To follow this walkthrough you need to be running
<a href="bundle_cherokee-admin.html">cherokee-admin</a>. This is an
administration tool, so you will need system administrator rights.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt># cherokee-admin
Cherokee Web Server 0.9.0 (Sep 16 2008): Listening on port 9090, TLS disabled,
IPv6 disabled, using epoll, 1024 fds system limit, max. 505 connections,
single thread</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>Now you can access the administration interface simply by opening your
web browser and visiting <a href="http://localhost:9090">http://localhost:9090</a></p></div>
<div class="para"><p>If your user doesn't have enough privileges you will be notified. Also
if no configuration file exists you will be prompted to create one
with the default settings.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="media/images/admin_noconfig.png" alt="cherokee.conf not present" title="cherokee.conf not present"/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="para"><p>That is a good starting point. Right now your web server will not be
running yet. We will only be using two of the available tabs to adjust
some more settings: <a href="config_general.html">General</a> and
<a href="config_virtual_servers.html">Virtual Servers</a>.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>This is an example of what you'll be seeing:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="media/images/admin_notrunning.png" alt="Server not launched" title="Server not launched"/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="para"><p>Of course, once we're done we will have to apply our changes and
launch the server. The configuration changes must be submitted to the
server, be it automatically if possible or by using the appropriate form
submitting buttons. But no change is reflected in the configuration
file until you <tt>Apply</tt> the changes. You can be sure of not damaging
anything while playing around with <tt>cherokee-admin</tt>. At least not
until you <tt>Apply</tt> the changes. Note that, if the Cherokee server is
running, the applied modifications will also affect the instance being
executed.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>This is what the <tt>General</tt> tab looks like:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="media/images/admin_general.png" alt="General" title="General"/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="para"><p>We will only be modifying the <strong>Server Permissions</strong>. It usually is a
poor choice to run services with super user privileges. Set both
<strong>User</strong> and <strong>Group</strong> to <tt>www-data</tt>. Your system might already have
another user account specifically for the purpose of running a
webserver. Use that instead if so, or create the <tt>www-data</tt> user if
you don't already have one.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Next is the <a href="config_virtual_servers.html">Virtual Servers</a> tab:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="media/images/admin_vserver.png" alt="Virtual server" title="Virtual server"/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="para"><p>When you start, you will only have one virtual server called
<tt>default</tt>. You can begin by cloning it as <tt>example</tt>.
While you are at it you should also append the following line to your
<tt>/etc/hosts</tt> file (in Windows you will find this as
<tt>%WINDIR%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts</tt>).</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>127.0.0.1       example.net example.org</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>This is to allow your system to resolve requests for <tt>example.net</tt> or
<tt>example.org</tt> locally. Of course, once you are out in the Wild (you
know, in the Internet), you will need proper DNS records.</p></div>
<div class="vlist"><dl>
<dt>
<strong><tt>default</tt></strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
We will leave default untouched except for the document root path,
which we will change. This is done through the <tt>Basics</tt> tab.
You could create by hand <em>/var/www/default</em> for example and set it up
in the appropriate field.
</p>
<div class="para"><p>If you access your machine by IP or a DNS resolution points in that
direction for any particular domain, the contents of your document
root directory will be exposed (<em>/var/www</em> by default unless you
changed that during the build process). Whenever there is no match for
a virtual server specifically defined in your list, the <tt>default</tt>
virtual server will be the one responding.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Right now any file with the <em>php</em> extension will be served after being
processed by the PHP interpreter (you should have <tt>php-cgi</tt> installed
in your system for this, though).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Any requested file would be sent. If a directory is requested, a file
called index.php or index.html will be served if it is present (the
search will be performed in that order; you can configure this in the
<tt>Basics</tt> tab). If not, a directory listing is offered instead. If you
would want to prevent this behavior but would like to keep up
serving whatever content is requested directly, simply change the
<tt>List &amp; Send</tt> handler for the <tt>Static Content</tt> handler.</p></div>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong><tt>example</tt></strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
For now this virtual server is an exact copy of the untouched
<tt>default</tt> virtual server. Create some new directories
<em>/var/wwww/example</em> and <em>/var/wwww/example/auth</em>, and configure the
first one as default document root path.
</p>
<div class="para"><p>Next, setup <tt>example.net</tt> and <tt>example.com</tt> in the <tt>Domain names</tt> tab.
We'll erase everything in the <strong>Targets</strong> list within the <tt>Behavior</tt>
tab, except the <tt>default</tt> rule. With this we'll only be able to serve
static content.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Accessing the URL <a href="http://example.org">http://example.org</a> should now show a list of
available files and directories under <em>/var/www/example/</em>.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Now lets password protect the <tt>auth</tt> directory. Add a new <tt>Directory</tt>
class rule pointing to <tt>/auth</tt>. Then, through the <tt>Security</tt> tab, add
a <tt>Validation Mechanism</tt> under <tt>Authentication</tt>.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The field <tt>Realm</tt> is mandatory. Lets set it as <tt>Secured Area</tt>.
If you choose <tt>PAM</tt> and impose no more restrictions, only users with
a local account in your system will be able to access the secured zone
at <a href="http://example.net/auth">http://example.net/auth</a>
Other mechanisms would work in a similar fashion but with their
specific requirements. For example, had you chosen <tt>Plain text file</tt>
instead of PAM you would have had to specify a <tt>Password File</tt>.
For example, it could have been <tt>/var/www/passwords.txt</tt> with the
following contents:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>testuser1:password1
testuser2:password2</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>Note that the rule must not be flagged as <tt>Final</tt>, or else no other
rules will be applied afterwards and no access will be given to any
contents. This is because at this point we have not defined any
handler for the <tt>/auth</tt> rule and nothing would be served.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Refer to the <a href="cookbook_authentication.html">Cookbook</a> for detailed
examples on the different options.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Lastly, lets configure a redirection rule by choosing a "Regular
Expression" as the new rule type. Type the following regex: <tt>^/rss.*$</tt>
Then, within the <tt>Handler</tt> selection tab specify a target: <tt>/feed</tt></p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="media/images/admin_rule_regex.png" alt="Regex" title="Regex"/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="para"><p>And voilà! A request of the form <a href="http://example.net/rss2">http://example.net/rss2</a> would be
redirected to <a href="http://example.net/feed">http://example.net/feed</a></p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Note that the <tt>Type</tt> of the <strong>Redirection</strong> is <tt>External</tt>. This means
the server will instruct the requesting web client to fetch the
redirected URL, which means the client will always know what the
final URL is. This also means the redirection can be done to servers
other than your own. If it were internal, the redirection would be
invisible (not showing the target  URL), but it would be limited to
the same <tt>virtual server</tt>.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>A much more general redirection could be one using these values:</p></div>
<div class="vlist"><dl>
<dt>
<strong>Regular Expression</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  <tt>^/(.*)$</tt>
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Substitution</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.example.com/example.net/$1">http://www.example.com/example.net/$1</a>
</p>
</dd>
</dl></div>
<div class="para"><p>Note that this rule would have to be external since <tt>example.com</tt> is
not among the domains managed by our configuration.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>This would redirect every petition to a site hosted under
<tt>http://example.com/example.net</tt>. For instance, the request for
<tt>http://example.net/image.jpg</tt> would return
<tt>http://example.com/example.net/image.jpg</tt>.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>If you need more details, Check out the documentation for the
<a href="modules_handlers_redir.html">redirection</a> handler.</p></div>
